## Before getting started

I just want to say a special thanks for looking to improve this project. I truly love the open source community and it wouldn't be what it is today without people like you.

# How to contribute

There are three main ways in which you contribute:

1. Open a [Bug Report](https://github.com/SomeRandomiOSDev/ProjectTemplate/issues/new?assignees=SomeRandomiOSDev&labels=bug&template=BUG_REPORT.yml&title=%5BBUG%5D%3A+).
2. Open a [Feature Request](https://github.com/SomeRandomiOSDev/ProjectTemplate/issues/new?assignees=SomeRandomiOSDev&labels=enhancement&template=FEATURE_REQUEST.yml&title=%5BFEATURE%5D%3A+).
3. Create a [Pull Request](https://github.com/SomeRandomiOSDev/ProjectTemplate/compare).

> If none of these really suit your needs, you could also open a [blank issue](https://github.com/SomeRandomiOSDev/ProjectTemplate/issues/new).
